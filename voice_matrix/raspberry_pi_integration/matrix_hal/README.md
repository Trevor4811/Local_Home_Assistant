# Matrix Hal Raspberry Pi Integration

For the first attempt we are using the Matrix Voice directly with the Raspberry Pi. This allows for the raspberry pi to directly interface with the matrix voice by using the matrix hal library.

## Raspberry Pi Install Instructions
Flash an SD card with the legacy version of raspberry pi OS using the raspberry pi imager application on another computer.

Run the install shell script on the new raspberry pi image.

## Installation Issues
Matrix HAL is only currently supported in Raspbian Buster version not Bullseye.
