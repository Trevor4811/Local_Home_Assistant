# Using matrix hal record with the raspberry pi

This is an example from the [matrix-creater-hal](https://github.com/matrix-io/matrix-creator-hal) repository and is installed from here. This may be installed by running the [install](../matrix_hal_rpi_install.sh) script. Then the compiled micarray raw record direct script can be found in the demos folder of the repository build. After recording the raw data it may be converted to wav files by running the [convert script](conv_raw.sh).

This repo seems to have been abandoned and many of the demo scripts do not work. However, it seems to be issues with the demo scripts and not the hal library itself.
